                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp,I've never written a line of code.I needed some structure from professionais who can help me learn programming step by step.I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.The agile team project,in particular,was outstandding.It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have ,in fact,I've often referred to it during interviwes as an example of my developent experience.It certainly helped me land a jobs as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offters.100% recommend!"</p>
